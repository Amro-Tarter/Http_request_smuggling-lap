# HTTP Request Smuggling Project

## Overview
HTTP request smuggling is a web application attack that allows an attacker to interfere with the processing of subsequent HTTP requests. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session fixation and cache poisoning.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate various techniques of HTTP request smuggling and to provide practical examples for educational purposes. It aims to raise awareness about the vulnerabilities in web application architectures.

## Features
- Detailed examples of HTTP request smuggling techniques.
- Case studies on vulnerabilities in popular web applications.
- Tools and scripts for testing and exploiting HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities.
